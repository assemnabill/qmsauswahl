abstract = {In numerous everyday domains, it has been demonstrated that increasing the number of options beyond a handful can lead to paralysis and poor choice and decrease satisfaction with the choice. Were this so-called paradox of choice to hold in search engine use, it would mean that increasing recall can actually work counter to user satisfaction if it implies choice from a more extensive set of result items. The existence of this effect was demonstrated in an experiment where users (N=24) were shown a search scenario and a query and were required to choose the best result item within 30 seconds. Having to choose from six results yielded both higher subjective satisfaction with the choice and greater confidence in its correctness than when there were 24 items on the results page. We discuss this finding in the wider context of "choice architecture"--that is, how result presentation affects choice and satisfaction.},

	abstract = {The new version of the standard ISO 9001:2015 strengthened and defined concretely the requirements for determining and accounting for external and internal environmental factors affecting the organizational quality management system. Important aspects of this issue are: the priority of environmental factors for monitoring and the choice of methods for their analysis, key categories of stakeholders and the main objectives for determining their requirements and expectations. The subject of this study concerns the expert evaluation of these aspects as to the context of an organization.

The purpose of the study is to assess on the basis of an expert survey the key aspects of the context of an organization relevant to the quality management system in the context of the practical implementation of ISO 9001:2015 requirements.

In this paper, we present the results of an empirical study conducted in the format of an Internet survey of quality experts, to identify the perception of the elements of the context of an organization that are relevant to the quality management system.

Results. The study allowed us to identify the most important external and internal factors for the context of an organization.}
